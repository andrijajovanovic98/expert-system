# Level 12: The Grand Challenge
# All operators combined in one puzzle.
# Think step by step!

A + B => C           # AND condition
C | D => E           # OR condition
E + !F => G          # NOT in condition
G ^ H => I           # XOR (H is false so G^H = true)
I => J + K           # AND in conclusion
J <=> L              # Biconditional
(A | B) + (C | D) => M
!(A + B) => N        # NOT of AND: A+B is true, so !(A+B) is false
